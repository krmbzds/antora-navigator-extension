= Antora Navigator Demo

This example provides a demonstration for how to use this extension with a site that uses the default UI (or a derivative of it).

If you haven't yet cloned the repository, follow these steps first:

 $ git clone https://gitlab.com/opendevise/oss/antora-navigator-extension.git
   cd antora-navigator-extension
   npm ci
   cd example

Once you have completed those steps, you can run the example using the following command:

 $ npx antora antora-playbook.yml

You will see xref warnings.
These are the result of only building a selection of content from the Antora demo and Asciidoctor docs.
You can safely ignore these warnings.

Since this extension is still experimental, you'll notice that some assembly is still required.
